OOSass
===

A scaffold for sass/scss based projects.

You can extend it as you need.

**Base**

The base directory is reserved for Sass code for base elements, normalize stylesheet, custom reset code and base typography declarations.

**Fonts**

The fonts directory is reserved for custom fonts source files.

**Helpers**

The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS, things like mixin declarations, functions, variables, placeholder selectors.


**Layout**

The partials directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed. Break stylesheets into (header, sidebar, and footer components and a few others), or break into much finer categories (typography, buttons, textboxes, selectboxes, etcâ€¦).
The views directory is where page specific styles are constructed and partials combined or (if needed) modified and adapted to their container.


**Vendor**
The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project).
jQuery UI and a color picker are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory.
